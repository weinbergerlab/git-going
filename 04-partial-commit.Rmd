# Piecemeal staging and committing

Let's now make some more changes and commit them, as a way of exploring what staging and committing can do. First, run the code by clicking "Run App" at the top of the app.R file in RStudio. A window will open showing a slider on the left and a histogram on the right. Moving the slider changes the number of bars in the histogram.

Go back to the main RStudio window, and make the following two changes in the code

1. Change `max = 50` to `max = 100` on line 24
2. Change `faithful[, 2]` to `faithful[, 1]` on line 40

Rerun the app, and you will see that the slider can now go up to 100 and that the data being plotted has changed; we're now looking at the duration of eruptions, which has a bimodal distribution with peaks around 2.0 and 4.5. (Previously we were looking at the time interval between eruptions.)

Now we will commit these changes. These two changes are unrelated to each other, and it's usually a good practice to avoid putting unrelated changes in a single Git commit, so we will make two commits instead. 

This is where the point of staging will become apparent. Often, we'll just have one set of related changes, and then we can stage everything and commit it; but when we have multiple unrelated changes in our code, staging is what tells git what we want to include in a commit. 

Although RStudio theoretically lets you do partial commits, its interface for doing so is flimsy and has been broken on-and-off for over 3 years ðŸ¤¦, so we're going to use Atom for this instead. 

Start by saving app.R and then open GitHub Desktop. Since this is your first time running GitHub Desktop for this project, you'll first need to choose File > Add Local Repository from the GitHub Desktop menu and choose your Git Playground folder. Next, choose Repository > Open in Atom from the GitHub Desktop menu.

Atom will show you a list of files on the left. If the right side of the Atom window isn't showing the Git panel, choose View > Toggle Git Tab to show it. Now look under "Unstaged Changes" in the Git panel, and click on app.R. That will open app.R in the middle section of the Atom window, and if you scroll around it, you will see that it's only showing you the changes you made (with a few lines before and after, for context), rather than the whole file. 

Click on the first line of the first of your two changes, then shift-click on the second line of the same change. That will select those two lines; next, click "Stage Selected Lines" right above them. As soon as you stage that two-line change, it will disappear, because you are only looking at unstaged changes. 

Enter an appropriate commit message on the right (such as "Increased slider range to 100"), and click "Commit to master". 

Repeat the same process to stage and commit the second two-line change with a message such as "Show eruption duration instead of time between eruptions".
